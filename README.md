# CF_Daily_Reminder

A tool I created back in Q1 of 2020 for the then woman I was crushing on, to reminf her of her daily codeforces practice. Based on her problem solve count each day, it would automatically select a good or a bad (if solve count < 2) image. That along with a mail containig her solve count would then be automatically send to her email.
